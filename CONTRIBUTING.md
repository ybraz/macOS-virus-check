## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- macOS 10.15 or later
- Python 3.8+
- pip
- Git

### Setup Development Environment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/macos-virus-check.git
cd macos-virus-check

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install development tools (optional)
pip install pytest black flake8 mypy

# Run from source
python3 src/cli.py --help
```

## Coding Guidelines

### Python Style

- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) style guide
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and concise

Example:
```python
def calculate_file_hash(file_path: Path) -> str:
    """
    Calculate SHA256 hash of a file

    Args:
        file_path: Path to the file

    Returns:
        SHA256 hash as hexadecimal string

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If file doesn't exist
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

### Code Formatting

```bash
# Format code with black
black src/

# Check style with flake8
flake8 src/

# Type checking with mypy
mypy src/
```

### Testing

- Add tests for new features
- Ensure existing tests pass
- Test on actual macOS systems
- Verify both CLI and Quick Action work

### Documentation

- Update README.md for new features
- Add examples to QUICKSTART.md
- Update CHANGELOG.md
- Include docstrings in code
